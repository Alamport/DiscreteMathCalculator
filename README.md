## Introducing the Problem
One problem I found when working on a homework was the lack of sites to create Venn diagrams for discrete math. 

The closest site to solving this problem is Wolfram; however, there are many limitations that exist:
    1) Lack of operations such as '-'
    2) A difficult user interface that creates confusion
    3) a

## Solution
Here, I plan on creating a flexible site that can handle various statements with the possibility of expanding it to more expansions in the future.


### Possible Expansions
There are different ways in which
